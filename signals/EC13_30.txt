ANSI/AAMI EC13:2002
4.2.6.3 Drift tolerance
The cardiac monitor shall indicate the heart rate within the error limits of 4.2.7 when a 0.1 Hz triangular wave of
4 mV p-v amplitude is superimposed on a train of QRS signals of 0.5 mV amplitude, 100 ms duration, and 80 bpm
repetition rate.

4.2.7 Range and accuracy of heart rate meter
The minimum allowable heart rate meter range shall be 30 bpm to 200 bpm, with an allowable readout error of no
greater than ±10 percent of the input rate or ±5 bpm, whichever is greater. Cardiac monitors labeled for use with
neonatal/pediatric patients shall have an extended heart rate range of at least 250 bpm. In addition, input ECG
signals at rates less than the disclosed lower limit of the rate meter range shall not cause the meter to indicate a rate
greater than this lower limit. Input signals at rates above the disclosed upper limit of the rate meter range, up to
300 bpm (350 bpm for monitors labeled for use with neonatal/pediatric patients), shall not cause the meter to
indicate a rate lower than this upper limit.
