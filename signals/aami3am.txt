for Figures 3a–3c, 60 s records are provided, and for Figure 3d, a 48 s record is provided.

1) Apply the test waveform of Figure 3a to the input of the monitor.
2) The indicated heart rate shall agree with the manufacturer’s disclosed value.
3) Repeat steps (a) and (b) for the waveforms shown in Figures 3b, 3c, and 3d.
NOTE—Gain or sensitivity controls may be adjusted for each waveform.
