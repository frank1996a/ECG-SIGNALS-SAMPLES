5.1.2 Operator manual
5.1.2.1 Disclosure of performance specifications

c) Tall T-wave rejection capability. A 20 s interval between tests is acceptable to allow the monitor under
test to stabilize. Tests must be performed with the monitor at the nominal gain setting of 10 mm/mV for
devices with permanent displays. If the device does not provide a permanent display, the gain setting must
be specified at the time of test.

1) Apply the test waveform of Figure 2a to the input of the monitor, with the parameters specified in
4.1.2.1(c) and 4.2.6.1 (1 mV QRS, 100 ms QRS duration, 80 bpm).
2) Record the indicated heart rate when the amplitude of the T-wave (a T ) is zero.
3) Increase a T in steps of 0.2 mV, at the rate of one step per minute, up to 1.2 mV, until either the
indicated heart rate exceeds the allowed ±10 percent tolerance or erratic heart rate indication is
obtained. The highest value of a T for which the heart rate meter indicates 80 ± 8 bpm shall be no less
than the value of a T disclosed by the manufacturer. If the manufacturer indicates that performance is
affected by monitoring versus extended low-frequency bandwidth choice, check at both bandwidths.
