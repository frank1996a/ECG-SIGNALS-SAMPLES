g) Time to alarm for tachycardia. The test waveforms of Figure 4 are available from AAMI. In those files, the
following signals are included:

For Figure 4a, 30 seconds of 80 BPM triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4a’s
VTACH at 1X gain;
(then) 30 seconds of 80 bpm triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4a’s VTACH at
.5X gain; and
(then) 30 seconds of 80 bpm triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4a’s VTACH at
2X gain.
For Figure 4b, 30 seconds of 80 bpm triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4b’s
VTACH at 1X gain;
(then) 30 seconds of 80 bpm triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4b’s VTACH at
.5X gain; and
(then) 30 seconds of 80 bpm triangular QRS pulses are followed by 60 seconds of Figure 4b’s VTACH at
2X gain.

1) Apply the test waveform of 4.2.6.1 and Figure 6 to the monitor input, with the QRS amplitude set at
1.0 mV and the duration at 100 ms.
2) Set the rate at 80 bpm, the upper alarm limit closest to 100 bpm, and the lower alarm limit closest to
60 bpm.
3) Suddenly change the input signal to the waveform of Figure 4a.
4) Measure the time interval until the alarm is activated.
5) The time interval shall not exceed the manufacturer’s disclosed value.
6) Repeat steps 1 through 5 with the amplitude of the waveform in Figure 4a halved and doubled.
7) Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the waveform of Figure 4b.
NOTE—Each test shall be repeated five times and the results disclosed as the average and range for the five trials.
