ANSI/AAMI EC13:2002
4.2.6.2 Line frequency voltage tolerance
The maximum line frequency peak-to-valley sinusoidal voltage amplitude that can be superimposed on a train of
QRS signals without exceeding the error limits specified in 4.2.7 for indicated heart rate accuracy shall be no less
than 100 μV p-v. The QRS signal shall have an amplitude of 0.5 mV, a duration of 100 ms, and a repetition rate of
80 bpm. If equipment is fitted with a line frequency filter, the filter may be turned on during this test.
